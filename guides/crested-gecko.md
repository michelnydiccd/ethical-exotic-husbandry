## 1. Natural Habitat and Behavior

### Native Range
Crested geckos are endemic to the southern portion of New Caledonia, a group of islands in the southwest Pacific. They inhabit tropical rainforests and coastal forests.

### Climate & Vegetation
- **Temperature:** Daytime 22‑27°C (72‑80°F), nighttime drops to 18‑22°C (65‑72°F).
- **Humidity:** High humidity (60‑80%) with regular rainfall and nightly mist.
- **Habitat:** Arboreal; they spend most of their time on tree trunks, branches, and among foliage.

### Behavior
- **Nocturnal:** Active at night, sleeping in sheltered spots during the day.
- **Arboreal:** Excellent climbers, using specialized toe pads (setae) and a prehensile tail (which can be dropped and will not regenerate).
- **Social:** Generally solitary; housing multiple geckos requires careful monitoring for aggression, especially among males.
- **Handling:** Can be handled gently but should not be stressed. Support the whole body and avoid grabbing the tail.

### Seasonal Variations
In the wild, they experience a slightly cooler, drier season (June‑August) and a warmer, wetter season (December‑March). Captive environments can mimic these cycles to promote natural behavior.

## 2. Enclosure Requirements

### Size & Dimensions
- **Minimum for one adult:** 45 × 45 × 60 cm (18 × 18 × 24 in) tall. Larger is always better.
- **Vertical space is critical**—crested geckos are arboreal and need height for climbing.
- For pairs or small groups, increase floor area and provide multiple visual barriers.

### Substrate
- **Options:**
  - **Coconut fiber (coir):** Holds humidity well, mold‑resistant, safe if ingested in small amounts.
  - **Orchid bark / cypress mulch:** Good drainage, natural appearance.
  - **Bioactive mix:** A layered substrate with drainage layer, substrate barrier, and a living soil layer that hosts springtails and isopods (clean‑up crew).
- **Depth:** 5‑8 cm (2‑3 in) to allow for planting and burrowing of clean‑up crew.
- **Avoid:** Sand, gravel, walnut shell, or any sharp/abrasive materials.

### Heating & Lighting
- **Temperature gradient:** Provide a warm area of 24‑27°C (75‑80°F) and a cooler area of 22‑24°C (72‑75°F). Nighttime drop to 18‑22°C (65‑72°F) is beneficial.
- **Heating:** Use a low‑wattage ceramic heat emitter (CHE) or a radiant heat panel controlled by a thermostat. **Never use heat rocks.**
- **Lighting:** UVB lighting (2‑5% UVB output, shaded‑weller style) is recommended for 10‑12 hours a day to support calcium metabolism and natural behavior. A simple LED grow light can benefit live plants.
- **Photoperiod:** 12 hours light / 12 hours dark; adjust seasonally if desired.

### Humidity & Ventilation
- **Ideal humidity:** 60‑80% with a nightly spike (up to 90%) during misting.
- **Misting:** Mist the enclosure heavily once or twice a day, preferably in the evening when geckos become active. Use de‑chlorinated water or rainwater.
- **Ventilation:** Screen tops or side vents are essential to prevent stagnant air and respiratory issues. Balance humidity retention with airflow.

### Décor & Hiding Places
- **Climbing structures:** Plenty of branches, vines, and cork tubes arranged vertically and horizontally.
- **Live plants:** Pothos, snake plants, bromeliads, ferns, and philodendrons provide cover, improve humidity, and enrich the environment.
- **Hides:** Multiple hiding spots at different heights—cork flats, coconut hides, commercial reptile hides.
- **Foliage:** Artificial or real leaves create visual barriers and reduce stress.
- **Water dish:** A shallow dish of fresh water should always be available, though crested geckos often drink droplets from leaves.

## 3. Diet and Nutrition

### Primary Diet
- **Commercial Crested Gecko Diet (CGD):** A complete, powdered diet mixed with water. Brands like Pangea, Repashy, and Leapin’ Leachie are widely recommended. Offer CGD every other day for adults, daily for juveniles.
- **Insects:** Appropriately‑sized gut‑loaded insects (crickets, dubia roaches, black soldier fly larvae) can be offered 1‑2 times a week as a supplement. **Never feed wild‑caught insects.**
- **Fruit:** Occasional small amounts of mashed fruit (banana, papaya, mango) can be offered as a treat, but commercial CGD already contains fruit.

### Supplementation
- **Calcium:** Dust insects with pure calcium carbonate (without D3) at every feeding.
- **Calcium with D3:** Use a calcium+D3 powder once a week if UVB lighting is not provided. If using UVB, D3 supplementation can be reduced.
- **Multivitamin:** A reptile‑specific multivitamin powder once every two weeks.
- **Note:** Many CGDs are already fortified with vitamins and minerals; check the product label to avoid over‑supplementation.

### Hydration
- Crested geckos drink water droplets from leaves and walls after misting. A shallow water dish should be present but may not be used regularly.
- Ensure water is clean and free of chlorine/chloramine (use a de‑chlorinator).

## 4. Common Health Issues and Veterinary Care

### Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD)
- **Cause:** Calcium/phosphorus imbalance, lack of UVB or D3.
- **Signs:** Limpness, curved limbs, jaw softening, difficulty climbing.
- **Prevention:** Proper supplementation, UVB lighting, balanced diet.

### Retained Shed (Dysecdysis)
- **Cause:** Low humidity, poor hydration, underlying health issues.
- **Signs:** Dried skin stuck on toes, tail tip, or around eyes.
- **Prevention:** Maintain adequate humidity, provide a humid hide, monitor during shed.

### Respiratory Infections
- **Cause:** Chronic low temperatures, poor ventilation, high ammonia from waste.
- **Signs:** Wheezing, mucus around nostrils, open‑mouth breathing, lethargy.
- **Prevention:** Stable temperatures, good airflow, clean enclosure.

### Parasites
- Internal parasites (nematodes, protozoa) can be introduced via wild‑caught insects or new geckos.
- **Signs:** Weight loss, diarrhea, lethargy.
- **Prevention:** Quarantine new animals, feed only captive‑bred insects, regular fecal exams by a reptile veterinarian.

### Tail Loss (Autotomy)
- Crested geckos can drop their tail when stressed or grabbed. The tail will not regenerate.
- **Prevention:** Handle gently, avoid grabbing the tail, provide a low‑stress environment.

### When to See a Veterinarian
- Any signs of illness lasting more than 24‑48 hours.
- Injury, abnormal swelling, or bleeding.
- Loss of appetite for more than a week.
- Fecal exams during annual check‑ups are recommended.

## 5. Enrichment Activities

- **Diet variety:** Rotate different flavors of CGD, offer different insect types, occasional fruit treats.
- **Foraging:** Hide insects in foliage or use feeding ledges to encourage natural hunting behavior.
- **Environmental changes:** Rearrange branches and hides occasionally (but not too frequently to cause stress).
- **Climbing opportunities:** Add new branches, vines, or cork tubes periodically.
- **Training:** Some keepers train geckos to hand‑feed, which can build trust and mental stimulation.
- **Safe exploration:** Supervised time outside the enclosure in a secure, predator‑free area (e.g., a playpen with plants).

## 6. Ethical Sourcing and Legal Considerations

### Captive‑Bred vs. Wild‑Caught
- **Always choose captive‑bred** individuals. Wild‑caught geckos often carry parasites, suffer from stress, and their removal harms wild populations.
- **Reputable breeders:** Look for breeders who provide health records, maintain clean facilities, and are transparent about genetics and lineage.
- **Adoption:** Consider adopting from reptile rescues or re‑homing groups.

### Legal Status
- **United States:** No federal restrictions, but some states or municipalities may have regulations. Check local ordinances.
- **International:** CITES Appendix II listing (since 2019) requires permits for international trade. Always verify import/export laws.
- **Travel:** When moving across borders, ensure compliance with both source and destination regulations.

### Conservation Status
- **IUCN Red List:** Least Concern (population stable).
- **CITES:** Listed in Appendix II to ensure sustainable trade.
- **Support conservation:** Donate to organizations working on habitat preservation in New Caledonia, such as *Pro-Natura International* or *Island Conservation*.
