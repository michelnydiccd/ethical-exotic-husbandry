# Ethical Exotic Husbandry

Comprehensive, ethical care guides for exotic animal species, emphasizing animal welfare, natural behaviors, and responsible husbandry practices.

## Mission

Our mission is to provide scientifically accurate, ethically sound, and practical care information for exotic animal species kept in captivity. We believe that exotic pet ownership comes with significant responsibility, and our guides prioritize the animal's physical and psychological well-being above all else. We advocate for:

- Understanding and respecting natural behaviors
- Providing appropriate environmental enrichment
- Ensuring proper veterinary care and nutrition
- Promoting ethical sourcing and conservation awareness
- Discouraging the keeping of wild animals that cannot thrive in captivity

## Repository Structure

- `/guides` – Detailed care guides for specific species, each in its own Markdown file.
- `/templates` – Templates for creating new care guides and issue checklists.
- `/resources` – Additional resources such as recommended books, scientific papers, supplier lists, and legal information.

## How to Contribute

We welcome contributions from experienced keepers, veterinarians, biologists, and ethical enthusiasts. Please follow these guidelines:

1. **Research & Citations**: All care information must be backed by credible sources (scientific literature, reputable husbandry manuals, expert consensus). Include citations where appropriate.
2. **Focus on Welfare**: Emphasize the animal's needs, not convenience. Discuss potential challenges and ethical considerations.
3. **Use Templates**: Start with the template in `/templates` to ensure consistent structure.
4. **Pull Request Process**:
   - Fork the repository.
   - Create a new branch for your guide (`feature/species-name`).
   - Add your guide to `/guides`.
   - Open a Pull Request with a clear description linking to the related issue.
   - Your PR will be reviewed for accuracy, completeness, and adherence to ethical standards.
5. **Code of Conduct**: Be respectful, constructive, and kind. We do not tolerate harassment, misinformation, or advocacy for harmful practices.

## Code of Conduct
